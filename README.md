- Python 3.9
- Taskwarrior

```

### Setting Up the Environment

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:ManjunathaThimmaiah/CLI_Tests.git
   cd CLI_Tests
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow is triggered on every push and pull request to the `main` branch. It performs the following steps:

1. Checks out the repository.
2. Installs Taskwarrior.
3. Sets up Python 3.9.
4. Installs the dependencies.
5. Runs the tests.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
6. Create a new Pull Request.
